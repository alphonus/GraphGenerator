# Installation on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 and CUDA 11.1
Using default Makefile, there is no bug when installing BiGG in this environment.

# Installation on different devices and environments
The installation of BiGG requires one more step, i.e., check the computing capability of your gpu.

## check the computing capability
Visiting this website, we can query the corresponding computing capability: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus

## choosing specific Makefile
According the query result, choosing specific Makefile_xx as your Makefile.

For example, if BiGG needs to be installed on GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, the `Makefile_75` needs to be renamed as `Makefile`.
